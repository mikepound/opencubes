# How to run

To run this project, install rust (doing so through [rustup] is the most straightforward)

Then, in a terminal or command window, navigate to the `opencubes/rust` directory and run:

```shell
cargo run --release -- enumerate <n>
```

where n is the count of cubes for which to calculate the amount of unique polycubes.

enumeration flags
```
Usage: opencubes enumerate [OPTIONS] <N>

Arguments:
  <N>  The N value for which to calculate all unique polycubes

Options:
  -p, --no-parallelism
          Disable parallelism
  -c, --no-cache
          Don't use the cache
  -z, --cache-compression <CACHE_COMPRESSION>
          Compress written cache files [default: none] [possible values: none, gzip]
  -m, --mode <MODE>
          [default: standard] [possible values: standard, rotation-reduced, point-list]
  -h, --help
          Print help
```
For more info, run:

```shell
cargo run --release -- --help
```

Commands:
  enumerate  Enumerate polycubes with a specific amount of cubes present
  pcube      Perform operations on pcube files
  help       Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

## Performance
- Times are cumulative (includes time to calculate all subsets from n=3).

- Times are measured with a large sample set of 1 run in an environment with many background processes of varying resource intensiveness throughout and rounded to 3 sig figs

- No cache files used (hashless uses N=12).

- Working with Low% speedrun rules - more cubes is always better no matter the time,
a faster time is better than a slower time if cube count is equal.

OoM - Out of Memory - unable to run due to memory limitations but we can dream

NA - didnt try, probably out of memory but had an estimated time in hours so didnt measure
